### Project Description:  
A web application designed to help beginner knitters interpret written patterns as visual matrices.

### Project set-up

One-time set-up:
- Install Yarn by following [Yarn installation instructions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
  
- Run `yarn install` in the project directory to install required dependencies  
- Run `yarn add react-collapsed` 
- Run `yarn add react-tooltip` 

To start a server & run the app in development mode:
- Run  `yarn start` in the project directory 
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### Patterns:
-Max 500 characters per row  
-Max 500 rows  
-Max 500 stitches per row  
-No more than 200 consecutive stitches. Stitch must include count, ie K5, up to 200  

Stitches can be:  
-CO (Cast-on)  
-K (Knit)  
-P (Purl)  
-BO (Bind-off)  

### Testing patterns:

NB: Copy only the pattern, not including the Cast-on instructions. The cast-on will be generated by the program.
